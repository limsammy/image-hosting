# Documentation Structure

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `README.md` | Quick start, project overview, links to docs |
| `CLAUDE.md` | AI assistant context and MCP workflow |
| `PLAN.md` | Implementation plan (10 phases, 36 steps) |
| `docs/setup.md` | Detailed installation guide |
| `docs/development.md` | Development workflow and commands |
| `docs/architecture.md` | System design and decisions |
| `docs/environment.md` | Environment variable reference |
| `docs/mockups/` | UI/UX wireframes (Phase 2) |

## Conventions

- Keep README.md concise (quick start only)
- Detailed docs go in docs/ directory
- API docs auto-generated by FastAPI at /docs
- Use tables for structured information
- Include code examples for all commands

## Future Additions

If docs grow significantly, consider adding MkDocs:
```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
mkdocs new .
mkdocs serve
```

Current structure is MkDocs-compatible (markdown in docs/).
